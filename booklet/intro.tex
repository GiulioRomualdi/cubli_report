\section*{Introduction}
In this report the theory of nonlinear systems is applied to a mechanical system known in the literature
as the Cubli \cite{Gajamohan2013}. It is a reaction wheel based 3D inverted pendulum consisting of a $\SI{15}{\centi\meter}$
sided cube with flywheels mounted on the three faces.

\par
In the section one the equations of motion of the system are derived in standard manipulator form and are rewritten
in control affine form which is required to apply the theory of nonlinear systems. Also the equilibria of the system
are described.
\par
In the section two and three the theory regarding nonlinear controllability and observability is briefly recalled
and then is applied to the system.
\par
In the last section a nonlinear controller is developed using the Noninteracting approach, from Isidori, which is
introduced preliminarly. Then the results of the simulation in which the cube perform a pure yaw motion while balancing
on its corner are presented.
